### IFS-FESOM

- [ ] LRA cannot be combined for ocean and atmospheric sources, maybe it should be rebuilt.
- [ ] The monthly-025deg-atm2d source search for a not existing fix.
- [ ] Source monthly-native-oce2d-elem area file generation does not work, check of the grid file is necessary.

### IFS-NEMO

- [ ] Check of the fixes, IFS is searching for IFS-default that is not associated to IFS-FESOM model, but to IFS only.
