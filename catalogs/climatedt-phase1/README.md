# ClimateDT Phase1 production catalog

This catalog contains the data for the ClimateDT Phase1 production.
The data are stored on Lumi HPC and on the Data Bridge (Lumi or MN5).
All the experiment are written on FDB.

Please be aware that not for all the experiment a detailed check wether the data are still on the Data Bridge or on Lumi HPC has been done.
If you encounter a possible issue, please open an issue in the Climate-DT-catalog repository.

The updated status of the Data Bridge transfer is available at the following link:

At the current stage only the Data Bridge on Lumi HPC is accessible with AQUA.
