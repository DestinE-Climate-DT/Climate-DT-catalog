# What is this catalog?

This is the catalog for the E cycle of the first cycle of 2025.
It contains a structure to organize the result of the run for the three models involved in the ClimateDT project.

New machine names generated for the operators on Lumi and MN5 are:

- Lumi: `lumi-e25.1`
- MN5: `MN5-e25.1`

Using this machine will point to the correct location for grids and observations necessary for the analysis of such models.
