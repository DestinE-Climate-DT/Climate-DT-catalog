### 

ERA5 dataset is donwloaded from CDS making use of a simple tool. It requires ECMWF api to be installed, please check the documentation
https://github.com/oloapinivad/CDS-retriever
The tool can be run in update mode so that when a new complete year is available, it can be retrieved
Given that folder structure is slightly different, a wrapper is prepared here for wrapper_cds.sh to loop on the avaiable variable
